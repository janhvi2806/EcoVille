    <div id = "header4">Through COVID-19, we starting using face masks to protect ourselves. The majority of us use plastic face masks, which we throw away after one use. This is really bad for the environment. As an alternative to plastic masks, you can use cotton masks which have become quite common now. Remember to wash them often to stay safe! <br><br><br></div>
